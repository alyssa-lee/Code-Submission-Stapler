# Code-Submission-Stapler
Simple Python script to merge multiple files into one .txt file. Includes a header, table of contents, and titles to separate files.

Feel free to use it to make your life easier, and modify it in any way that works best for you. :)

Disclaimer: This was created to make it easier to submit code from multiple files as a single .txt file, as required for the class 02-251: Great Ideas in Computational Biology. It does NOT contain any information related to 02-251 assignments.
